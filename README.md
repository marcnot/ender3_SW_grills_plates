# ender3_SW_grills_plates

##Info
This is part of an Ender3 (No V2/Pro) to Voron Switchwire Conversion. This git only contains files that I have adapted for an Ender3 to Switchwire conversion. Origin was the conversation from https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW.

I changed a few things to adapt it to the normal Ender3.

**My CAD skills are very limited.** I have checked everything again but there is a possibility that the parts do not fit 100%. I had no problems fitting the parts to my conversion! If you have any suggestions, feel free to send them to me via Discord.
