# Ender3 SW grills & plates

## Info
This is part of an Ender3 (No V2/Pro) to Voron Switchwire Conversion. This git only contains files that I have adapted for an Ender3 to Switchwire conversion. Origin was the conversation from https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW.

I changed a few things to adapt it to the normal Ender3. The design from Darkdog is for the V2/Pro (4040), but the Y-Extrusion on the normal Ender3 is 2040. 

**My CAD skills are very limited.** I have checked everything again but there is a possibility that the parts do not fit 100%. I had no problems fitting the parts to my printer! If you have any suggestions, feel free to send them to me via Discord (infisqt#1597).

To adapt the rear grills to your printer, the Y extrusion must be moved. Please read the information of this conversion through https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire. On the last picture you can see how to move the Y-extrusion.

In short: The rear screw of the Y extrusion must go into the front hole. Through the empty hole, an M5 screw and T-slot can be used to provide a little stability again. But please read the informations on the other repository!!!

## Files

The Parts should already be in the right orientation. Maybe you need to rotate them a little bit for your printer.

- grill_rear_middle: You need to create some supports for the place where your Y-Motor sits! 
- The right/left Grills have some holes for heatinserts, so you can screw in the endcaps.
- deckplates: I think you can print them in PLA if you dont consider to enclose your printer. If you want to enclose it, please use ABS or at least PETG! 

You should print the sensorless homing Beldmount in the recommended settings of the Voron team!

For the grills and plates a little less infill and top/bottomlayer should be ok (**This is my opinion! If you have doubts, please print it as in the recommended settings** ).
